Viewport is the rectangle area where things are visible to you. The document can be 
larger than that and you'll see scrollbars if so.

Viewport: It is your device screen.

Window: It is your browser window. The window can be as big as viewport or smaller.

Document: It is the webpage. It can be bigger than viewport or even bigger than window.

Notes: Some websites are for not created for mobiles. Hence the webpage/document is much 
bigger than the mobile viewport and you have to swipe to see the parts that spill outside 
the screen. On a desktop, you can make the window of your browser smaller or same as the 
viewport/monitor.
